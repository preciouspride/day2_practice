# #range() => function that creates  range object
# #range takes 3 types of arguments - 1 argument, 2 arguments, and 3 arguments
# var = range(5) # range object gives you variables from a starting number (inclusive) to an ending number (exclusive)
# ## IF RANGE HAS 1 ARGUMENT, IT IS THE END, AND THE START IS 0
# print(list(var))

# var1 = range(0, 5) #IF RANGE TAKES 2 ARGUMENTS, THE FIRST IS THE STARTING ARGUMENT (INCLUSIVE), AND THE SECOND IS THE ENDING ARGUMENT (EXCLUSIVE)
# print(list(var1))

# var2 = range(3, 5)
# print(list(var2))

# var3 = range(0, 5, 1) #IF RANGE TAKES 3 ARGUMENTS, THE FIRST IS THE STARTING ARGUMENT (INCLUSIVE), AND THE SECOND IS THE ENDING ARGUMENT (EXCLUSIVE). THE 3 ARGUMENT IS THE STEP
# print(list(var3))


# var4 = range(0, 5, 2) #IF RANGE TAKES 3 ARGUMENTS, THE FIRST IS THE STARTING ARGUMENT (INCLUSIVE), AND THE SECOND IS THE ENDING ARGUMENT (EXCLUSIVE). THE 3 ARGUMENT IS THE STEP
# print(list(var3))


var4 = range(1, 11, 3) #IF RANGE TAKES 3 ARGUMENTS, THE FIRST IS THE STARTING ARGUMENT (INCLUSIVE), AND THE SECOND IS THE ENDING ARGUMENT (EXCLUSIVE). THE 3 ARGUMENT IS THE STEP
print(list(var4))
